# Question 1 
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# Question 2
#Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

# Question 3
# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# question 4 
#Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false)

#Question 5
#Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.
